## 🧠 About Tirhuta (मिथिलाक्षर)

Tirhuta is the traditional script of the Maithili language, historically used across the Mithila region.
While modern Maithili is often written in Devanagari, Tirhuta remains an important part of Maithili’s
cultural and literary heritage.

Mithila-Lipi does not translate meaning — it only converts the **writing system**.
