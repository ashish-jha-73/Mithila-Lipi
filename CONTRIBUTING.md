# Contributing to Mithila-Lipi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Mithila-Lipi**.

This project is open, non-commercial, and focused on supporting the Maithili language and its traditional script (Tirhuta).

---

## 🎯 Project goals

Current scope:
- Script-level conversion from **Devanagari → Tirhuta**

Future goal (community-driven):
- An **AI-based English → Maithili (Devanagari) translator**, which can then be used as input for Tirhuta conversion

---

## 🤖 Call for contributions: English → Maithili AI translation

We welcome contributions related to building or researching an **English → Maithili translation system**, especially:

- Parallel datasets (English ↔ Maithili)
- Linguistically correct Maithili corpora
- NLP / ML models for low-resource languages
- Rule-based or hybrid translation approaches
- Evaluation of existing translation quality

The focus should be on **Maithili language correctness**, not Hindi approximation.

---

## 🧠 Important principles

- Maithili is treated as an **independent language**
- Devanagari is used as the **working script**
- Tirhuta conversion remains a **separate, script-level step**
- No proprietary APIs or closed datasets
- Cultural and linguistic accuracy over speed
